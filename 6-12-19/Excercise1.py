 widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English 
 language and the world's greatest dramatist.
  He is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). 
  His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets, 
  two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. 
  His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed 
  more often than those of any other playwright'''
